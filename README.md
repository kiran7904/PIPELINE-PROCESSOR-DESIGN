Description:
In this task, Iâ€™m building a basic 4-stage pipelined processor that follows the instruction execution cycle: Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Write-back. Instead of processing one instruction at a time, this pipeline allows multiple instructions to be executed in different stages simultaneously, improving efficiency. The processor will handle basic operations like ADD, SUB, and LOAD.
